# SRNet-Datagen - A data generator of SRNet

&nbsp;
## Introduction
This is a data generator of SRNet which is the model described in the paper *Editing Text in the wild*.

Our tensorflow reproducing of SRNet: [https://github.com/youdao-ai/SRNet](https://github.com/youdao-ai/SRNet)

Original paper: [*Editing Text in the wild*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03047) by Liang Wu, Chengquan Zhang, Jiaming Liu, Junyu Han, Jingtuo Liu, Errui Ding and Xiang Bai.

This data generator project is a simplification based on the following two projects.

[Synthtext](https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText): Extracted the rendering part of the project and Adjusted to Python3 code to get `i_s`, `t_t`, `t_f` and `mask_t`

[Skeletonization-of-Digital-Patterns](https://github.com/anupamwadhwa/Skeletonization-of-Digital-Patterns): Adjusted this project to Python3 code to skeletonize mask_t and get `t_sk`.

## Generate data
First prepare a directory of fonts and a background datasets without text. You can also prepare a word corpus for rendering. 

You need to write the absolute path of each data in the background dataset as a line into a file, and modify `bg_filepath` parameter of `Synthtext/data_cfg.py` to the path of this file. 

You can adjust other data configurations in `Synthtext/data_cfg.py`. The following is a description of some parameters.

- `font_dir`: the directory path of fonts in ttf format.

- `standard_font_path`: the standard font to render i_t.

- `text_filepath`: a file containing the text of the word to be rendered, each line is a word.

- `bg_filepath`: a file containing the absolute path of each background image.

- `color_filepath`: a file used to select the color of the text which is given by Synthtext project.

Then you will need to adjust generating configurations in `cfg.py` including saving directory, the amount of data to generat and the number of processes that are needed.

Finally `python3 datagen.py` and start generating.

You can also use this project to generate data online while training SRNet.

- `i_s`: styled text a rendering on background image

- `i_t`: standard text b rendering on gray background

- `t_sk`: skeletonization of styled text b.

- `t_t`: styled text b rendering on gray background

- `t_b`: background image

- `t_f`: styled text b rendering on background image

- `mask_t`: the binary mask of styled text b
